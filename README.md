This repository contains some of my algorithms developed for the "Algorithms and Data Structures" course. These algorithms were designed to fit within specified memory usage limits and solve particular problems. They range from the Euclidean algorithm and bubble sort to solving specific problems such as the Bin Packing Problem.
